Q 1. Look at the data given below. Plot the data, find the outliers and find out  μ,σ,σ^2
Name of company	Measure X

Allied Signal	24.23%

Bankers Trust	25.53%

General Mills	25.41%

ITT Industries	24.14%

J.P.Morgan& Co.	29.62%

Lehman Brothers	28.25%

Marriott	25.81%

MCI	24.39%

Merrill Lynch	40.26%

Microsoft	32.95%

Morgan Stanley	91.36%

Sun Microsystems	25.99%

Travelers	39.42%

US Airways	26.71%

**Q 2. Answer the following three questions based on the box-plot above.**

    (i)	What is inter-quartile range of this dataset? (please approximate the numbers) In one line, explain what this value implies.
    
        Ans: Approximately (First Quantile Range) Q1 = 5 (Third Quantile Range) Q3 = 12, Median (Second Quartile Range) = 7 
        **(Inter-Quartile Range) IQR = Q3 – Q1 = 12 – 5 = 7 Second Quartile Range is the Median Value**
        
    (ii) What can we say about the skewness of this dataset?
    
         Ans: Right-Skewed median is towards the left side it is not normal distribution
    
    (iii) If it was found that the data point with the value 25 is actually 2.5, how would the new box-plot be affected?
    
          Ans: In that case there would be no Outliers on the given dataset because of the outlier the data had 
          positive skewness it will reduce and the data will normal distributed
        

**Q 3. Answer the following three questions based on the histogram above.**

    (i)	Where would the mode of this dataset lie?

        Ans: The mode of this data set lie in between 5 to 10 and approximately between 4 to 8 .

   (ii)	Comment on the skewness of the dataset.

        Ans: Right-Skewed. Mean>Median>Mode
        
    (iii) Suppose that the above histogram and the box-plot in question 2 are plotted for the same dataset. 
          Explain how these graphs complement each other in providing information about any dataset. 
          
          Ans: They both are right-skewed and both have outliers the median can be easily visualized in box plot where as in histogram mode is more visible.
