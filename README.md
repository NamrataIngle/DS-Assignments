**Q 2. Answer the following three questions based on the box-plot above.**

    (i)	What is inter-quartile range of this dataset? (please approximate the numbers) In one line, explain what this value implies.
    
        Ans: Approximately (First Quantile Range) Q1 = 5 (Third Quantile Range) Q3 = 12, Median (Second Quartile Range) = 7 
        **(Inter-Quartile Range) IQR = Q3 – Q1 = 12 – 5 = 7 Second Quartile Range is the Median Value**
        
    (ii)	What can we say about the skewness of this dataset?
    
    (iii)	If it was found that the data point with the value 25 is actually 2.5, how would the new box-plot be affected?
